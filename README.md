# 🛒 Product Network Analysis for E-commerce Optimization (Amazon Co-Purchase Network)

**By UKANDU Chidinma**

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I conducted a **Network Analysis** on the Amazon Co-Purchase Dataset to uncover how products are grouped, bought together, and connected within communities. The goal was to simulate real-world applications for **ShopDesk**, a product focused on helping e-commerce and retail businesses optimize their **inventory and sales strategies**.

This project was completed as part of **HNG Internship Stage 7**, where I explored six insightful research questions using **Python**, **NetworkX**, **Louvain community detection**, and **interactive visualizations** with Plotly and Matplotlib.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand customer buying behavior by analyzing product co-purchases.
- Identify tightly connected product groups, influential products, and bridge items.
- Generate insights that support **product bundling**, **cross-selling**, and **inventory decisions**.
- Apply real-world **business intelligence** strategies for ShopDesk.

## 🧠 Key Research Questions

1. How many communities exist within the co-purchase network?
2. Are certain communities more self-contained, with fewer external links?
3. What is the distribution of community sizes?
4. Which products act as bridges between different communities?
5. Which product pairs have the strongest co-purchase relationships?
6. What is the average clustering coefficient of the network?
